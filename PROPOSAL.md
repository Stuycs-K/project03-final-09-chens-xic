# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Cathleen and Stacey

# Intentions:

Our project will expand upon the previous music library project to include features that will play music and directly interact with music files. 	

# Intended usage:

The terminal will continuously prompt the user for a song title or playlist name (that is in our music library) and will play a song after receiving input. After the song/playlist has finished playing, the user will be prompted to input another song title. Each song that the user plays will be stored on to a user history file. The program will end when the user hits ctrl c.When the program restarts, the user has the option to play their previous songs saved on the file.

# Technical Details:

This project will be using many of the topics we covered in class, such as processes. We will fork and exec to play music, and use stat to find information about the files (such file size). The userâ€™s song lists and information about each song will be stored as text on files. The user will have to download a music player app.
Nice to Have features:

-Pause song

-Skip song

# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.

1/7 - reconstruct and optimize music library

1/9 - find music player and integrate with program

1/13 - store user and song data on files, finish minimum viable product
